### DungeonDraw 1.6

A simple dungeon editor in Python/Tkinter for role-playing games like for example "Dungeons & Dragons".

Just draw your walls and doors on a grid.

Version 1.6: Also draw symbols for stairs and for "points of interest" (circles of different colors) in a dungeon: Select the corresponding option in the menu, put the cursor on a vertical line and press the mouse button. The symbol is drawn into the box to the right of the line.

Requirements on Windows 10 are "Python 3" from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). And the `Pillow`-library. To get it, open the "Windows PowerShell" and run the command
```
pip install Pillow
```
In the program, available keys are: `w` Draw wall, `d` Draw door, `r` Remove drawings. The color of the cursor shows, in which mode you're in.
